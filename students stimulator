// a java program to describe the kind of character someone have.
// Despite the fact that this code needs some portal for survey, i'm currently unable to create portals, so i have just asked for inputs as the answers to survey.
// Hope you like it, and by this code i don't mean to hurt anybody's feeling
//So, don't be extreme serious be this code.
